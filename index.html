    <h1>Youth Rugby Coaching: Don't Skip this in Practice!</h1>
    <img src="images/defense.jpg" alt="My test image">
    <p>The title of this page is obviously there to draw you in. As you many not like the answer
      , but one of the most overlooked areas in youth rugby coaching, is <strong>DEFENCE</strong>. 
      You know Americans will scream it in basketball games. In my experience, youth especially, teams 
      do not focus on this area enough and in enough detail!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tackling</li>
      <li>Positioning in different scenarios</li>
      <li>Working as a team in defence</li>
      <li>Tactics, roles, etc. </li>
      <li>In all honesty the list can go and on... So, start with the above and go from there</li>
    </ul>
